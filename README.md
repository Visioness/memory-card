# Avengers Memory Card Game

Avengers Memory is a fun and challenging memory card game featuring your favorite Marvel superheroes. Choose your difficulty level (Easy with 5 cards, Medium with 8 cards, or Hard with 12 cards), then test your memory by clicking on different Avengers character cards without repeating any selections. Each time you successfully pick a new card, your score increases and the cards shuffle, making it progressively harder to remember which heroes you've already chosen. The goal is to click on all the cards exactly once to achieve a perfect score, but be careful - clicking the same card twice will end the game!
